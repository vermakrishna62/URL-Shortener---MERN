## Full stack MERN project -  Url shortener

URL Shortener - MERN Stack
This repository hosts a comprehensive URL Shortener application developed on the robust MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Below is an in-depth overview of the application's functionalities and key components:

URL Shortening:

Users can effortlessly input lengthy URLs and acquire shortened versions, significantly enhancing readability and usability. This feature simplifies the sharing and management of long web addresses.
Redirecting:

Upon visiting the shortened URL, users are seamlessly redirected to the original long URL. This transparent process ensures a smooth user experience without compromising functionality.
User Authentication:

The application implements robust user authentication mechanisms to safeguard user accounts and data. This includes secure user registration, login, and session management functionalities, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources.
User Dashboard:

The application boasts a feature-rich user dashboard, offering users a centralized platform to efficiently manage their shortened URLs.
Within the dashboard, users can perform a range of actions including:
Viewing a comprehensive list of their shortened URLs.
Editing existing shortened URLs to update their destination or metadata.
Deleting unwanted shortened URLs to maintain a clutter-free environment.
Accessing analytics and insights to track URL usage metrics, such as click counts and geographic distribution (if implemented).
Personalizing settings and preferences to tailor the user experience according to individual preferences.
Error Handling:

Robust error handling mechanisms are integrated into the application to gracefully manage and communicate errors to users. This ensures a seamless user experience by providing clear and actionable feedback in the event of unexpected errors or edge cases.
Security Considerations:

Security is of paramount importance, and the application prioritizes the implementation of best practices to safeguard user data and ensure secure communication.
Key security measures include:
Implementation of JWT-based authentication to securely authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.
Encryption and hashing techniques to protect sensitive user information, such as passwords and authentication tokens.
